My name is Marek Murgaš. You can find me online by the handle n0xturne. I’m an offensive security enthusiast based in Czech Republic with a bachelor's degree in Information Security. Since 2022, I have been actively solving Hack The Box machines and trying to learn as much as possible about hacking. The purpose of this blog is to share write-ups for CTF challenges and my personal projects. I hope the knowledge shared here will be helpful to others.
