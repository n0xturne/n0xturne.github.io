## Summary

By brute-forcing directories on port 80 I discovered `/admin` directory. Accessing it revealed `Pi-hole Version v3.1.4` application. Using `dirsearch` for `/admin` directory showed interesting files. One of them suggest that the target might be `Raspberry Pi` machine. I was able to `SSH` into the system by using default credentials for `Raspberry Pi`. Enumerating system as user `pi` revealed that this user can run any command with `sudo`. After spawning root shell I found message inside `root.txt` file stating that the backup of this file should be on USB stick. By looking at contents of `/media/usbstick`, I found another text file with message saying that all files from USB stick were deleted. To recover deleted files, I created image from USB drive. Analyzing image with `TestDisk` revealed that `root.txt` used to be present on drive. I was able to retrieve the flag by running `strings` command against image file.

## Enumeration

### Service Enumeration


| **IP Address** | **Ports Open** |
|-------|--------|
| 10.10.11.180 | **TCP**: 22, 53, 80, 32469, 32400 |


#### Port 80

##### Technology

```
lighttpd 1.4.35
```

##### Directory Brute Force

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:FUZZ -u http://10.10.10.48/FUZZ -ic -fs 369
```

##### /admin - Pi-hole 

Accessing `/admin` directory reveals `Pi-hole Version v3.1.4` application. Unfortunately I do not have any valid credentials to log in.

###### Dirsearch

```
dirsearch -e php,asp,aspx,jsp,py,txt,conf,config,bak,backup,swp,old,db,sql -u http://10.10.10.48/admin
```

![dirsearch.png](/assets/img/Mirai/dirsearch.png)


The contents of `http://10.10.10.48/admin/.git/logs/HEAD` suggest that the target might be a `Raspberry Pi` machine.

```

#### Port 32469

```
Platinum UPnP 1.0.5.13
```

## Initial Foothold

Assuming that target is `Raspberry Pi` machine, I tried to `ssh` into the system with default credentials:

```
pi : raspberry
```

## Privilege Escalation

### System Enumeration

Running `sudo -l` showed that user can run any command with `sudo`. 

![sudoL.png](/assets/img/Mirai/sudoL.png)

### Root Shell 

First I spawned root shell. 

```
sudo sh -c /bin/bash
```

![escalation.png](/assets/img/Mirai/escalation.png)

### Recovering root.txt

Inside `root.txt`, I found message stating that backup file should be on USB stick. 

![rootHint.png](/assets/img/Mirai/rootHint.png)

By looking at contents of `/media/usbstick`, I found another text file with message saying that all files from USB stick were deleted. 

![hint2.png](/assets/img/Mirai/hint2.png)

To recover deleted files I used [TestDisk](https://github.com/cgsecurity/testdisk) , but first I created image of USB disk and transferred it to my local machine. 

Listing available disk partitions on system:
```
sudo fdisk -l
```

Creating image:
```
sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sdb of=/tmp/image.img
```

After transferring `image.img` file to my local machine, I was able to list deleted files by using `TestDisk`. 

![testdisk.png](/assets/img/Mirai/testdisk.png)

I was not able to recover contents of `root.txt` but now that I know that it used to be present on disk, I tried to reveal more data by running `strings` command against image file. This revealed the root flag.
